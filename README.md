# A Simple Pedometer

## Usage
This is a straightforward, plug and play Pedometer that shows your step count over the last 7 days or, lacking that, some mocked data.

Load the app through Xcode using your preferred target, or by going to the external testing link [to be determiend](https://www.google.com).

Clicking on any given day will bring you to a detailed view that will show you how close you were to hitting the recommended 10,000 steps per day, as well as a bit more information on how your day went.

# Roadmap
## User Facing
1. Active updates - show step count change while app is open

## Internal
2. Add generator for mocks
